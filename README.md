 Evaluation of Restaurant Ratings Using **MongoDB** and **Pymongo**
  As part of this project, database related to restaurants across the United Kingdom was evaluated.
  
## Step 1: Importing Dataset and Setup of Collection
The provided restaurants datasets in json format was imported to Mongo database as *'uk_food'* and saved with a collection name as *'establishments'* using the below command:

*"mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json"*

After importing the required dependencies, a connection to MongoDB is made and all the existing *databases* as well as *collections* in the MongoDB are listed. 

Using *find_one()* function one of the document of the ***establishments*** collection is reviewed, in order to confirm that all documents are imported properly.

## Step 2: Adding Document to Collection and Updating fields 
As part of this process, a new document (dictionary) related *Penang Flavours* is created based on data provided in the BCS. The document is added to *establishments* collections using *"insert_one()"* function. 

The presence of document in collection was verified using *'find_one()'* function. **Penang Flavour** type of restaurants were compared in order to obtain the missing *'BussinessTypeID'* information from the collection. The relevant field of the restaurant was updated and verified.

## Step 3: Deleting Documents from Collections

As part of this process, initially number of documents (restaurants) located in the local government area ('Dover') in the collection were estimated using *'count_documents'* function.

The documents were deleted from the *establishments* collection using *delete_many()* function and the deletion process was later verified.

It was also verified that deletion process did not removed documents of restaurants located in local government areas.

## Step 4: Converting Strings to other Datatypes

Longitudes, Latitudes and Rating values of documents were converted to Double and Integer respectively using *data conversion functions*. The datatype conversion were later verified.
